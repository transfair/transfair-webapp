MAIN SITE
Transfair is an actively managed but largely decentralized service that identifies and connects reliable service partners from low-income countries with price sensitive clients in Europe.
Our core business is to identify and develop capable service partners in low-income countries, to suitably match them with projects from clients in high-income countries, to monitor the quality, manage the workflow and make small scale north-south outsourcing quick, simple, safe and accessible to everyone.
Our mission is to sustainably enhance the welfare in low-income countries by activating the dormant potential of its people.
